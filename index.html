            I was warmly welcomed to the cottages with their spacious rooms and
            all my needs catered for, including quirks and writing foibles. The
            company was good, the food delicious, and the goody bag on my bed
            was a lovely surprise. If you are thinking of going on the type of
            retreat where you have absolutely nothing else to worry about but
            writing, reading, relaxing this is for you.

            I liked it so much, I went back to the same place only five months
            later! This group was smaller than the retreat back in April but
            just as fun and the less time I spent watching movies in the evening
            meant I got more writing done.

          <p>
            When the mind was too tired to carry on writing, I loved having the
            opportunity to talk about books, pets, and all the minutiae of
            writing life over coffee and evening meals with the other attendees.
            I have enjoyed the weekend so much, I think I may have to indulge
            myself with a retreat more regularly.
